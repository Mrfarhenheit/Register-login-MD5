# Register-login-MD5
## I have made a registration and login form using HTML, CSS, JAVA and PHP for user 
inputs. Registration form stores data in database. “Registered Successfully” dialogue box 
is shown when all credentials are fulfilled. Login page check email and password from 
database. “Login Successfully” dialogue box shows up when email and passwords are 
matched from the database. If not “Record not found” showed up. For password hash, I
used MD5 message-digest algorithm which produce a 128-bit hash value. It is represented 
as a sequence of 32 hexadecimal digits. Below is an example of MD5 hash function.
MD5("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog") =
